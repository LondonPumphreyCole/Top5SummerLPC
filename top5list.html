<li> <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/hurricaneharborla">Hurricane Harbor</a> (Waterpark, obviously)</li>

<p> The highlight of my summer, the nice beginning, the Hurricane Harbor!</p> 
<p> I went with a few friends, went on a waterslide crazier than a feminist on CNN,</p>
 <p> and I learned how to use the Lazy River to travel across the entire park!</p>
<li> 4th of July Party (Watched my cousin get hurt by being stupid!) </li>

<p> For the second best part of my Summer, I chose the 4th of July Party!</p>
<p> After the first hours of boredom from being forced to do nothing but read Hooked stories and</p>
<p>watch some dumb kids repetitively fail at Minecraft, my cousins finally arrived! </p>
<p> When they arrived we had a great deal of fun. We had a water balloon war,</p>
<p>we played Football, we did a lot of fun things and later at night, I watched a firework be lit up close,</p>
<p> and thats when my cousin got hurt. At least it was nothing bad enough to go to the doctor about...</p>
<li> Pool Party </li>
<img src="pool.jpg" height="160" width="180">
<p>Before any of those but wasn't so fun, was a Pool Party hosted by the LDS Church out of all things (my Summers get real sad...)</p>
<p>First coming in I thought it would be fun, we did a longest diving contest, some idiot tried to pull my trunks off,</p>
<p> but I ended up catching him, offending him and making him so embarrassed he had to leave. Yeah that's the highlight of the party... (I told you, my summers get real sad!) 
<li> Trip to Running Springs! </li>
<img src="springs.jpg" height="160" width="200">
<p>Enough with that cringy embarrassment, onto my first and only trip during Summer! I went to Running Springs!</p>
<p>During Running Springs we got to stay with my aunt and we went hiking, played some weird games, I finally figured out how to use snapchat (Yeah I felt real stupid),</p>
<p> and I caught some real nice photos up there!</p>
<li> <a href="http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/LÃºcioball">Overwatch Summer Events!</a> </li>
<img src="overwatchsummer.jpg" height="160" width="230">
<p> Onto my least favorite and most stressful part of Summer that STILL hasn't ended, Overwatch Summer!</p>
<p> The stress of that is Lucioball, the most obnoxious part of the game with my worst character, Lucio.</p>
<p> In Lucioball, you're basically playing Rocket League but instead of Cars or whatever you use, you get to use Lucio in the game.<p>
<p>
<p> But if that was it, I would just avoid Overwatch till it's over. But that's not all... I get to deal with the high rarity and low luck with Loot Boxes!</p>
<p>I really wanted Sporty Tracer, Biker Reaper, and Grillmaster: 76 but what do I get? None of those!</p>
<ol>
</body>
<p> Overall, my Summer was pretty good! I went to Running Springs, I went to Hurricane Harbor, and I had the greatest 4th in a LONG time!</p>
<p> Yes, I had a bad time at my only pool party, I hated the Overwatch Summer Event I looked forward to, but I still had a great time with everything else on my list!</p>
